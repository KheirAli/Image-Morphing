# Image-Morphing
Morphing is a special effect in motion pictures and animations that changes (or morphs) one image or shapes into another through a seamless transition. Traditionally such a depiction would be achieved through dissolving techniques on film. Since the early 1990s, this has been replaced by computer software to create more realistic transitions.
